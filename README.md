# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
Given breast cancer results from breast fine needle aspiration (FNA) test (is a quick and simple procedure to perform, which removes some fluid or cells from a breast lesion or cyst (a lump, sore or swelling) with a fine needle similar to a blood sample needle). 

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

I did Data cleaning, data visualization, and made a Model which can predict the presence of Breast Cancer in a person.
